# odin-recipes

This project involves creating a list of recipes which link to their own respective HTML pages. 

The idea behind this project is to demonstrate an awareness of basic HTML knowledge through a benign foray into the world of cuisine. 

This page will eventually become a demonstration of my CSS skills as well.
